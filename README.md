## **About Me**

I'm a CS graduate student passionate about building intelligent systems that actually work in the real world.

**What drives me:** The gap between research and reality. I love taking cutting-edge ideas and figuring out how to make them robust enough for real applications.

**Current obsession:** Neural network compilers and making AI systems run efficiently on edge devices (because not everything needs a GPU cluster).

---

## **What I'm Working On**

### **🤖 [Neural Network Compiler Framework](https://github.com/SoutrikMukherjee/Neural-Network-Compiler-Framework)**
> Making neural networks run faster on everyday hardware

Started this project after getting frustrated with how slow ML inference was on my Raspberry Pi. Built a compiler that converts PyTorch models to optimized machine code. Still learning MLIR/LLVM but seeing some promising speedups!

*Technologies: C++, MLIR, LLVM, Graph Optimization*

### **🔗 [Human-Robot Collaboration System](https://github.com/SoutrikMukherjee/human-robot-collaboration)**
> Natural language control for robotic systems

Part of my research at UPenn. Working on letting people control robots through natural conversation instead of complex programming. The latency challenges are fascinating and humbling.

*Technologies: ROS2, Python, Computer Vision, NLP*

### **📈 [ML Stock Predictor](https://github.com/SoutrikMukherjee/ML-Stock-Price-Prediction)**
> Learning about markets through machine learning

Personal project combining financial data with news sentiment analysis. More about understanding how ML works with time series data than getting rich quick 😄. Includes full backtesting because "it works on my laptop" isn't enough.

*Technologies: LSTM, NLP, Python, Backtesting*

### **⚙️ [Distributed Control Systems](https://github.com/SoutrikMukherjee/Distributed-Control-System)**
> Exploring fault-tolerant industrial systems

Started as a class project, grew into a deep dive into how industrial control systems handle failures. Testing consensus algorithms across multiple VMs to understand what happens when things go wrong.

*Technologies: C++, MPI, Real-time Linux*

---

## **My Toolkit**

```python
class WhatIKnow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.comfortable_with = ["Python", "C++", "MATLAB"]
        self.learning = ["Rust", "CUDA", "Triton"]
        self.ml_stack = ["PyTorch", "JAX", "TensorRT"]
        self.robotics = ["ROS2", "Gazebo", "Real-time Control"]
        self.interests = ["Compilers", "Distributed Systems", "Edge ML"]
        
    def current_challenge(self):
        return "Making 1kHz control loops actually reliable"
        
    def what_excites_me(self):
        return "When theory meets messy reality and still works"
```

## **Background & Journey**

- 🎓 **Currently:** MS in Computer Science at Harrisburg University (Scientific Computing focus)
- 🔬 **Research:** Modular Robotics Lab at UPenn (working on real-time control systems)
- 🏭 **Previous:** Embedded systems intern at ISRO (learned about aerospace-grade reliability)
- 📚 **Undergrad:** Design & Manufacturing Engineering at NIT Rourkela

**Side story:** Started [MANAV](https://github.com/SoutrikMukherjee/MANAV), a student org in India that teaches programming to kids in government schools. Began when I realized how many talented students had no exposure to technology. Now working with 12 schools - it's become something I'm really proud of.

---

## **Recent Learning**

- **Paper I'm digesting:** "Attention Is All You Need" (finally understanding transformers properly)
- **Current rabbit hole:** GPU kernel programming with Triton
- **Debug victory:** Finally got my CAN bus communication working reliably (only took 3 weeks 😅)
- **New appreciation for:** How hard real-time systems actually are

---

## **Looking For**

🌟 **Summer 2025 Internship** in ML Infrastructure, Robotics, or Systems Programming

I'm drawn to teams that:
- Build things people actually use
- Care about making technology accessible
- Value learning and iteration over perfection
- Work on problems that matter

---

## **Fun Facts**

- Used to play cricket competitively (learned about pressure and teamwork)
- Fascinated by manufacturing processes (yes, I watch factory tours on YouTube)
- Believer in first principles thinking
- Coffee enthusiast (essential for debugging distributed systems)
- Always down to discuss why your favorite programming language is wrong 😄

### **Let's connect!**

I love talking about technology, research ideas, or just hearing about what you're building.
